# This alters the default behavior of the completion functions
# in a fashion similar to show-all-if-ambiguous. If set to On,
# words which have more than one possible completion without any
# possible partial completion (the possible completions don't
# share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately

# It may be set to any integer value greater than or equal to zero.
# If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal to

# user wishes to view them; otherwise they are simply listed on the
# terminal. A negative value causes readline to never ask.

# a single match into the line. It's only active when performing

# not insert characters from the completion that match characters
# after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word

# will set it to On if the locale contains eight-bit characters.

# Do not convert characters with the eighth bit set to an
